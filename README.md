## *Description*
This is my first project created using Java; it is noteworthy that no other programming language was used to build this application. After downloading the project and carrying out the proper command to start, you will be able to play a chess game with your friend, where all the game rules are treated and included so that your experience is incredible.

On this project you will be able to:
1) Move the pieces as the game;
2) Do Check and CheckMate;
3) See the pieces that were captured;
4) Do some special moves: Castle, Passant and Promote.
